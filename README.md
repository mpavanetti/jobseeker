**Software acting as an iPaaS solution integrating a powerful task scheduler, logging framework, dashboards preview and much more.**

If you are looking for a tool which can provide you an unified platform with task job scheduler (Talend, Windows Batch Scripts, Linux Bash Scripts, Python Scripts, Spark Jobs, etc) and also a system which has a logging platform for querying your build status, get customized notifications on email, different user roles permissions, file management and more, this tool was designed for you !

**Purpose :**

This tool is a platform contaning a combination of task scheduler, job management, logging framework, transaction monitoring framework, file manager, different user role accesses that can be great integrated with a cloud provider.

## Version Information
**1) Latest (master) -** Beta Version Released.

## User Management

### Default User and Password Table

Role | Login | Password | Description 
--- | --- | --- |--- 
System Administrator | admin@example.com | 123456 | Admin User
Developer | developer@example.com | 123456 | Developer User
Key User | keyuser@example.com | 123456 | Key User 

<br>Remember to change the default user and password once you implement the system.

### Explaining the available roles:

**System Administrator**: This is an infrastructure system administrator, wich access of creating users, groups, granting permissions, acessing to jenkins manager, database manager, server statistics.<br>
**Developer**: A developer user has permissions to manage files, upload files, create job builds, query logs, adding data visualizations, view jobs, delete jobs, manage jobs, run jobs, schedule jobs, query jobs status and more.<br>
**Key User**: A Key User or also called as Business user has permissions to query job build logs, analyze job run history, check dashboard, check all kind of logs.

## Installation

**[Check Out]**: Download or git clone this repository into your http server.

**[MariaDB Database]**: You need a MySql(MariaDB) insntance for hosting the system tables, after you have it implemented, you need to setup the jobseeker config files with your infrastructure info.<br>
**[Run Create Table Database script]**: You can find the db setup script at [db_setup.sql](db_setup.sql).<br>
**[Setup Database connections with jobseeker]**: Navegate into your jobseeker root folder in the following path: **jobseeker/application/config/database.php**. Edit the file [database.php](application/config/database.php) with a text editor and scroll up to the end and find the database parameters as following:<br>
```
$db['default'] = array(
	'dsn'	=> '',
	'hostname' => 'localhost',
	'username' => 'root',
	'password' => 'YOURPASSWORD',
	'database' => 'jobseeker',
	'dbdriver' => 'mysqli',
	'dbprefix' => '',
	'pconnect' => FALSE,
	'db_debug' => (ENVIRONMENT !== 'production'),
	'cache_on' => FALSE,
	'cachedir' => '',
	'char_set' => 'utf8',
	'dbcollat' => 'utf8_general_ci',
	'swap_pre' => '',
	'encrypt' => FALSE,
	'compress' => FALSE,
	'stricton' => FALSE,
	'failover' => array(),
	'save_queries' => TRUE
);
```
**Note:** Change only the parameters **hostname, username, password, database**.
<br><br>


**[Jenkins]**: The jobseeker tool needs a jenkins instance to operate over build executions and crontab scheduler, it basically sends requests to jenkins through a http API and get fetch the results as an intermediator. This is an optional feature but if you don't install jenkins, the jobseeker tool will only act as a transaction logging framework.<br>
Click to access the [Jenkins Setup](doc/Jenkins).<br>
After Finishing up the Jenkins Setup, navigate into your jobseeker folder, find the file [config.json](application/config/config.json) at **jobseeker/ application/config/config.json** edit it using a text editor.
```
{
    "jenkins": {
        "enabled": true,
        "url": "http:\/\/localhost:8080\/",
        "username": "matheus",
        "token": "11883b9bbf07ade64064dc291d899c34cc",
        "authorization": "Basic",
        "jenkins_home": ""
    },
    "setup": {
        "enabled": false,
        "env": ""
    }
}
```
If you choose to use jenkins, which I recommend, change the enabled parameter to true, insert your jenkins url, username and token.<br>
If you are implementing the system in a docker container and your jenkins is also in a docker container, you can specify the jenkins home as your container mapping directory.
