### Uploading a file
Note that when you create an input component , it will appear in the Available Jobs dropdown Menu in the way you created.<br>
Once you fill in the form with the values created in the input component, it will prompt you to upload a file with the filename you created.<br>
You can drag and drop or click in the dropzone on the right.

Uploading the file test.csv<br>
Once you get the success message, it means your file has been successfully uplodaed to the jobseeker repository folder according to your input component setup.<br>
For example in this case it will be: **jobseeker/repository/talend/input/dev/test.csv** <br>
So now you can call this file in your ETL job.
