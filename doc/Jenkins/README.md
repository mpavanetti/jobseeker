## Jenkins

### Jenkins is an optional feature for jobseeker, hence if you don't install jenkins you'll have a limited system usabillity.
<br>
Jenkins is a free and open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat.

## Download and install Jenkins into your infrastructure
You can have jenkins wherever you want, I personally recommend cloud instances always.
[Download Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/download/)

## Activate jenkins user token
### User tokens are needed for the jenkins remote api usage.
After you have downloaded and installed jenkins completely into your infrastructure , it's time to install some plugins and enable http cors, and create a token.<br><br>

### Installing jenkins additional Plugins
Login into your jenkins instance, go to **Manage Jenkins**, go to **plugins**.<br>
Make sure the plugin "Authentication Tokens API" is installed, if not, install it.
